<p>It seems that in version 2.0 of the Lytro Desktop app, the way photos are processed from RAW data has changed.</p>
<p>To my eyes, the color balance is much better. The images are also much smoother, which is often better and sometimes just different.</p>
<p>To compare, see the two images below. The first was produced with an older version of the Lytro Desktop app, the bottom was produced with the (new) version 2.0</p>
