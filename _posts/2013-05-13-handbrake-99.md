It looks like <a href='http://handbrake.fr/?article=17' title='HandBrake 0.9.9 Release Candidate 2'>the next version of HandBrake is nearing release.</a>

For those not familiar, HandBrake is a wonderful video transcoder that supports many formats and lots of options for tweaking.

One of my favorite features from this new version (and one of the first you're likely to notice) is the new interface for H.264 options. Rather than dealing with the **Advanced** panel, you can just specify the profile, level, and type of content to tune for.

For instance, if you need a video to work on a range of phones or tablets, you could specify **Main** profile, level **3.1** and tune for **animation**. Or maybe you'd tune for PSNR, or SSIM. And all this without having to deal with the **Advanced** options.

Still on my HandBrake wishlist:

* [Support for VP8](https://trac.handbrake.fr/ticket/140) (or even the upcoming [VP9](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57584018-93/googles-vp9-video-codec-nearly-done-youtube-will-use-it/))
* More options for audio compression
* OGG support, for encoding videos that work in older versions of Firefox (though I'm [not holding my breath for this one](https://forum.handbrake.fr/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=11201))
* [Opus](http://www.opus-codec.org/) support would be wonderful, once someone can figure out how to cram it into a Matroska container (a guy can dream, can't he?)
