<blockquote>Hi there!<br /><br />
Weâ€™re just dropping you a quick email to say that we see you have not been using
&#9604;&#9604;&#9604;&#9604;&#9604; recently
and we would like to let you know that our CEO
&#9604;&#9604;&#9604;&#9604;&#9604;&#9604;
will be hosting a &ldquo;Getting started with &#9604;&#9604;&#9604;&#9604;&#9604;&rdquo;
webinar to teach you how to get the most out of our best features.</blockquote>
<p>Any time I get an email like this, I wonder if I'm the only one who hasn't been using the service lately, or if they're
just sending these messages to everybody in a last ditch effort to get users to give the service a second look.</p>
<p>Obviously, the names have been removed.</p>
