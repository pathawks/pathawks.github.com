Dear Bit.ly,

It'd be super cool if you let me use my domain name with my Bit.ly account. You know, so that any links I shorten with my account are shortened with my own domain name.

Maybe I could even upgrade to some sort of pro account where any links from websites I specify are shortened with my own domain name.

Yeah, that'd be sweet.
**UPDATE:** Bit.ly seems to be taking my advice. See [bit.ly Pro](http://blog.bit.ly/post/356400453/bit-ly-pro-open-beta-and-enterprise-service "bit.ly Pro: Open Beta and Enterprise Service")
