<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/">Smart people are spending a massive ammount of time trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist.</a><br />
Trying to retrofit HTML to allow for things like quadruple-resolution images for <abbr title="High Dots Per Inch">HiDPI</abbr> monitors, and lower quality images for slower connections (ie. mobile).</p>
<p><img alt="File:Adam7 passes.gif" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Adam7_passes.gif" width="149" height="149" style="float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em">Why not just upload quadruple-resolution <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam7_algorithm">Adam7 interlaced PNGs</a> and, if the browser does not support HiDPI, the browser can simply stop downloading the image after the fifth pass.</p>
<p>On mobile, or any other connection where bandwidth is more of a concern than quality, it could stop after an even earlier pass.</p>
<p>Either way, making most efficient use of bandwidth <em>must be</em> the job of the user agent more then the content itself.<br />There must be a better solution than adding new (redundant) tags to HTML.</p>
