[Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) make Open Source Software.

GitHub makes Pull Requests easy.

When Pull Requests are easy, it encourages tinkering and sharing your changes upstream.

WordPress insists on using [Subversion for the plugins repository](http://wordpress.org/plugins/about/svn/).
This makes tinkering and sharing changes _quite_ difficult, as it has to be done through some external means of communication.

What I would _love_ would be if WordPress.org started using [GitHub](https://enterprise.github.com/) for the plugins repository.

Short of that, I would like to host my plugin on both GitHub _and_ the WordPress Subversion beast. I would like both repositories to always be in sync.  
This is far easier said than done.

I have been able to [import my WordPress plugin's Subversion repo to Github](https://gist.github.com/kasparsd/3749872), but I still don't really have a way to push to both locations at the same time.  
Yes, I have tried [git-svn](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html). What a mess.

I guess I will probably end up using GitHub for development, and just publishing to WordPress Subversion when something is ready for release.  
Like some glorified beast of an FTP server.
