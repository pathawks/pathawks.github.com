I neither like you, nor follow you, nor do I appreciate the loud autoplaying video that has nothing to do with the content on the page.

This was my first time visiting your website; I followed [a link from Techmeme](http://www.techmeme.com/130517/p28#a130517p28).

If you pause the video, it will automatically resume playing (with sound) after an interval.

While not displayed here, if you scroll down just a bit, there is another Facebook/Twitter banner **in the middle of the story**!

I'll not be returning.
