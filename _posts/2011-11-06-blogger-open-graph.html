<p>Adding <a href='http://ogp.me/'>Open Graph metadata</a> to a website can be a pain, and will almost certainly break your validation unless you&#8217;re using an RDFa Doctype&hellip;</p>
<p>Who am I kidding? Nobody ever uses RDFa Doctypes.</p>
<p>Fortunately for <a href='http://blogger.com'>Blogger</a> users, Blogger blogs never validate anyway, so adding Open Graph metadata is easy.</p>
<p>Simply copy the code below and paste it into your template after the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag.</p>
{% gist 1343315 og.html %}

<p>I&#8217;ve added this code to <a href='https://gist.github.com/1343315'>a Gist</a>, so feel free to fork it and modify it as you see fit. If you do something really cool, I&#8217;d love to hear about it.</p>
<p>A couple notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<code>og:locale</code> Should probably actually reflect the blog&#8217;s locale instead of just being a hardcoded string. Unfortunately, Blogger only gives us <code>en-us</code> with a hyphen, instead of an underscore, so that won&#8217;t work.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you&#8217;re using your blog as a personal profile, you may consider changing the second <code>og:type</code> from <code>website</code> to <code>profile</code> and adding <a href='http://ogp.me/#type_profile'>your personal information</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>og:image</code> Is only supplied if Blogger finds an image in the current post. However, not supplying <code>og:image</code> is invalid. You could provide an alternate image of your blog logo, or a Gravatar.
	</li>
</ul>
