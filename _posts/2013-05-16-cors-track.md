Can somebody please explain to me why `<script>`, `<img>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>` will happily display contents cross-origin, but `<track>` is freaking sacred and needs to follow _much_ stricter rules?

This is madness!

If I can play a video from server X, why can't I display captions from that server as well?
